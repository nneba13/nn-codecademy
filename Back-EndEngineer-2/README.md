# Codecademy - Project - Back-End Engineer

## Overview

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. You’re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

Project Objectives:

* Build a message generator program using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use command line
* Develop locally on your computer

Prerequisites:

* JavaScript
* Git and GitHub
* Command line

### Plan your project

Visualize your end result. What is it built with? What can it do? Make sure that it satisfies all of the project objectives.

Make a timeline for yourself and avoid the temptation to build things that aren’t required. Setting firm boundaries and deadlines will keep you on track and prevent scope creep.

The following tasks will help you identify natural break points.

### Come Up with a Topic

Decide on what types of messages you want your program to output.

Think about what kinds of messages you’d like your program to output. Is it a horoscope generator? A fortune teller? An inspiring phrase? Knock-knock jokes? Here’s an example of what the output of a horoscope generator could look like:

Your sign is sun.

You are having good luck.

You should: "trust no one"

Remember, to make your program truly random the message should really be made up of multiple strings that are output together.

Think about what parts of the string could stay the same each time and what parts could change. In the output above, what do you think are the pieces that change each time?

### Work

* Plan Your Project

This project will be a simple Dad Joke viewer. It will use NodeJs and display a random joke on the screen using a seasonal template. The list of jokes was compiled from https://icanhazdadjoke.com/ and https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/dadjokes.


* Come Up With a Topic

Humor is the best medicine for boredom so I choose Dad Jokes for the topic.


* Create Script and Run It Locally

On your computer, create a JavaScript file to write your code in. Make sure you are able to run your script locally in Node.


* Set Up Version Control

Set up Git tracking in your directory and add and commit changes as you make them.


* Store Message Components

Decide how to store all of the message components for your game.

Think about what kind of data structures would work best to store the information. An array would be a good choice here because you can randomly access an array’s elements. Remember, there will be at least 3 sets of data that make up your final message so you might consider having multiple arrays. You may want to nest these arrays inside of an object to keep them organized.


* Create The Message

Add functionality to randomly select the different message components so they can create a cohesive message.


* Put The Program Together

Combine the different parts of your program so the random messages are selected, combined, and then displayed to the user each time they run the program.
